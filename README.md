# Kata using Java
I used Java technology to do the Kata, I performed Test Driven Development process (first corrected the Unit Test, then I added my tests, I did the algo and I finally finalize the test code and the algo)  

In order to compile and test the code :  
1) Maven install  
2) Maven test
